# Semi-Supervised Learning for California Housing Dataset

This repository contains code and analysis for a semi-supervised learning project applied to the California Housing Dataset.

## Overview

This project explores the application of self-training in semi-supervised learning using different classification models on the California Housing Dataset, originally a regression problem converted into a classification task. The goal is to predict median housing prices' categories based on various features like location, population, median income, etc.
